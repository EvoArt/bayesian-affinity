abstract = {Scientists often need to know whether pairs of entities tend to occur together or independently. Standard approaches to this issue use co-occurrence indices such as Jaccard, Sørensen-Dice, and Simpson. We show that these indices are sensitive to the prevalences of the entities they describe and that this invalidates their interpretability. We propose an index, α, that is insensitive to prevalences. Published datasets reanalyzed with both α and Jaccard’s index (J) yield profoundly different biological inferences. For example, a published analysis using J contradicted predictions of the island biogeography theory finding that community stability increased with increasing physical isolation. Reanalysis of the same dataset with the estimator αˆ reversed that result and supported theoretical predictions. We found similarly marked effects in reanalyses of antibiotic cross-resistance and human disease biomarkers. Our index α is not merely an improvement; its use changes data interpretation in fundamental ways. Better similarity analyses fundamentally change the interpretation of results in diverse biological datasets.}}

 abstract = {There is growing interest in assessing relationships between two or more distance matrices, where distances are based on genetic, geographical, and/or environmental measures of dissimilarity for all pairwise combinations of n populations. Methods are developed and assessed for estimating confidence limits for the regression relationship between dependent matrix Y and matrix X and for estimating the value of x given critical y. Methods include a regression mixed model that incorporates an additional population effects variance and a jackknife-by-population regression method that omits the (n - 1) distance observations for each population in turn. The approaches are illustrated using data to quantify rates of gene flow with distance between wild plant populations of sea beet and are assessed using simulations.},

abstract = {Abstract Detailed information about the geographic distribution of genetic and genomic variation is necessary to better understand the organization and structure of biological diversity. In particular, spatial isolation within species and hybridization between them can blur species boundaries and create evolutionary relationships that are inconsistent with a strictly bifurcating tree model. Here, we analyse genome-wide DNA sequence and genetic ancestry variation in Lycaeides butterflies to quantify the effects of admixture and spatial isolation on how biological diversity is organized in this group. We document geographically widespread and pervasive historical admixture, with more restricted recent hybridization. This includes evidence supporting previously known and unknown instances of admixture. The genome composition of admixed individuals varies much more among than within populations, and tree- and genetic ancestry-based analyses indicate that multiple distinct admixed lineages or populations exist. We find that most genetic variants in Lycaeides are rare (minor allele frequency <0.5\%). Because the spatial and taxonomic distributions of alleles reflect demographic and selective processes since mutation, rare alleles, which are presumably younger than common alleles, were spatially and taxonomically restricted compared with common variants. Thus, we show patterns of genetic variation in this group are multifaceted, and we argue that this complexity challenges simplistic notions concerning the organization of biological diversity into discrete, easily delineated and hierarchically structured entities.},
